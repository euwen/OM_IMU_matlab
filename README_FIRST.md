OM_IMU_matlab
=============

Matlab based AHRS project for OpenMovement sensors www.openmovement.co.uk

Based around the open source AHRS algorithms published at https://github.com/xioTechnologies.

The script provides a realtime plot (in 2D or 3D) of the algorithm output which can subsequently be used for further development work.

The script is written in a cross platform way and has been tested on Windows and OSX.

The script communicates in asynchronous way with the sensor and can cope with baud rates of several hundred Hertz.

All code has been written for "clarity" rather than speed and it is hoped that the developer will make optimisations for application specific tasks.
